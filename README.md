# Notes and Code for Pymodaq Introduction Course at the EPFL

This is some note. I am running the pymodaq on Debian. 

I used the *mamba* and *mini-forge* environment as explained on the website. However, I had to install pyqt5 system-wide with `apt-get install` to be able to open e.g. the *daq_viewer*. Also I have to run `sudo daq_viewer`for it to work.
